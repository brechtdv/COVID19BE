## Data sources

- New hospital admissions: https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/
- Weekly age groups proportions of new hospital admissions: https://datastudio.google.com/embed/reporting/c14a5cfc-cab7-4812-848c-0369173148ab/page/JL1qB

## Note

- These graphs provide a biased view of the number of hospitalisations by age group, because the age distribution is obtained from the Clinical Survey (including hospitalisations due to and with COVID), while the number of new hospital admissions is obtained from the Surge Capacity Survey (including only hospitalisations due to COVID).
